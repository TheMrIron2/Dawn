# Dawn.
# Rising up from the darkness.

Dawn is Game Fusion's latest console, however it isn't a flagship.
Dawn's goal is to appeal to the general audience by making a nice, smart console in a simplified, compact manner.

Features:

• Disk Loader

• No APIs needed

• Extremely simple

• Achievement [easter egg]

• Stylish menu

• Monochrome PC support

Yes, you read that right.
# Monochrome PC support.

We're really trying to appeal to all stretches of the audience, including the CC users who are in survival and likely can't afford an advanced computer. Or for those who just prefer an old PC. Or for those emulating old PCs. Whichever way, that's how we're trying to get all types of people to try one smart console.
Either way, Dawn is a good move.
